    This is a remake of the T-Rex game that appears when you donâ€™t have access
    to the internet. I made the concept in Blender, and then, remade it with
    code. My goal, for this project, was mainly to play around with Three.js.
    You can find more informations in the github repository of this project
    (research process...).
