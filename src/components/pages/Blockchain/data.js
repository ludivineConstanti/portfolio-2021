    This project was made at the end of an online bootcamp given by the 'Ã‰cole
    O'clock'. I made it together with 3 other people. My role was to make the
    concept, design, and front-end. It is an educative website, where you can
    learn more about blockchains by playing quizzes and reading articles. The
    website is available in French and English.
