    I started learning Japanese when I was 17 ( I also worked as a design intern
    in Tokyo and Hiroshima). The first website I made, using Japanese characters
    (was really bad) used them as pixels to make illustrations.
    <br />
    <br /> I wanted to revisit this concept with my improved knowledge
    (design-wise and code-wise). This website helps practicing Japanese
    characters, with quizzes.
    <br />
    <br /> The illustration’s squares that contain Kanjis (Japanese characters)
    also show their pronunciation and their translation if you put your cursor
    over them.
    <br />
    <br /> I modified the UX a bit to make it easier to look at, as a portfolio
    project (there’s a cheating mode, activated by default, which shows the
    quiz’s answers). If you want to learn more, you can look at the project, on
    Github.
