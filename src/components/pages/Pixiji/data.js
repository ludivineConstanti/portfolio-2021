    I started learning Japanese when I was 17 ( I also worked as a design intern
    in Tokyo and Hiroshima). The first website I made, using Japanese characters
    (was really bad) used them as pixels to make illustrations. I wanted to
    revisit this concept with my improved knowledge (design-wise and code-wise).
    This website helps practicing Japanese characters, with quizzes. The
    illustration’s squares that contain Kanjis (Japanese characters) also show
    their pronunciation and their translation if you put your cursor over them.
    I modified the UX a bit to make it easier to look at, as a portfolio project
    (there’s a cheating mode, activated by default, which shows the quiz’s
    answers). <br />

    You can find more informations, with the code, in the github repository of
    this project.
