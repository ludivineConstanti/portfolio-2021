# Materials and colors ðŸŽ¨

I made the concept for the planet (that represents Paris) in Blender, and then exported it.

I used matCaps to make it better for performance, the colors are given by an other map, thanks to the model's UV. 
I used a white and blue matcap, since I think black / grey shadows are too harsh, 
but that didn't work out well, since the entire model is affected by one material, it looks fine on the white / blue colors, 
but the pink part looks like it has a strange filter, as if it's under water ðŸ¤¿

I tried again with a white / grey matcap, just in case, but it's not much better, the colors look very desaturated ðŸ“º

I then decided to use individual matcaps based on the colors. Instead of importing the planet as one mesh, 
I import meshes separately that I all add to a group, I can then give one material per mesh. This allows much more saturated colors. By trying various material, 
I thought the reflecting one looked good on the geometrical shapes that symbolize trees ðŸŒ³ so I also separated them to give them a special matcap.
I also added some reflection for the water ðŸŒŠ
