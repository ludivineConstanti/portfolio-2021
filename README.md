The projects shown in this portfolio were done entirely by me (including concept, design...) except for the project "An intro to Blockchain", which I worked on with 3 other people. You can look at their repositories here:

- [Pixiji](https://github.com/ludivineConstanti/Pixiji)
- [Dino 404](https://github.com/ludivineConstanti/dino-404)
- [An intro to Blockchain](https://github.com/ludivineConstanti/an-intro-to-Blockchain)

Technos that are used in this portfolio, and the project shown are;

- HTML, XML, CSS, Sass
- JavaScript
- React with Create React App
- React libraries (Styled Components, Framer Motion)
- Redux + Redux Toolkit
- ESLint
- Three.js
- Webpack

You can also find here [an other portfolio that I have on Behance](https://www.behance.net/Lu-di) (that I made while I was studying + working as a designer, so design only).

The âš¡âš¡âš¡ mdDocumentation folder âš¡âš¡âš¡ contains some observations made during the project (bugs, research for lighting...). Other observations are made in the code itself as comment.
